# Notes API platform with in-built swagger

## Setup

- `composer create-project symfony/skeleton <REPO>`
- `composer require api`
- Modify `.env` for DB connection
- `php bin/console doctrine:database:create && php bin/console doctrine:schema:create`
- Start symfony server : `symfony server:start`
- Added `composer require symfony/maker-bundle --dev`
- **NOTE** if `/api` is showing 404, install `composer require symfony/apache-pack`
- Add `Symfony profiler` by `composer req symfony/web-profiler-bundle` and verify URLs by `php bin/console debug:router`, then just go to `<URL>/_profiler`

## Documentation

- https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/serializer.html (The Serializer Component)
- https://api-platform.com/docs/core/serialization/ (The Serialization Process)
- https://api-platform.com/docs/core/operations/ (Operations)

## Database Structure

- Post : `1 Post has 1 Category`
- Category : `1 Category has 1/∞ Post`

## Usage

- Enabling crud endpoints can be done in 2 ways, need to modify `config/api_platform.yaml`
- - Using `Entity`, check `src/Entity/Post.php`
- - Using`yaml`, check `config/api_platform/resources.yaml`
- To activate API CRUD endpoints of an Entity, add `@ApiResource()` in class phpdocs
- To insert into *Post* with Swagger - "**POST `/api/posts`**"

- `normalizationContext` concerns more the `GET` and is related to when you are reading data from your API, so ALL endpoints that are tiggered will JSON response based on the `"groups"` they are connected to, i.e `read.post.collection`

````
 * @ApiResource(
 *     normalizationContext={
 *          "groups": {
 *              "read.post.collection"
 *          }
 *     }
 * )
 .
 .
class Post

.
.

 * @Groups(
 *     {
 *          "read.post.collection"
 *     }
 * )
 */
private $title;

````

- Collection operations : `GET` & `POST`
- Item operations : `GET` & `PUT` & `DELETE` & `PATCH`
- `itemOperations` for `put` has `denormalization_context` with group `write.post.item` and so does attribute `$id`, `$slug` and `$category`

````
 *          "put": {
 *              "denormalization_context": {
 *                  "groups": {
 *                      "write.post.item"
 *                  }
 *              }
 *          }
````
- So if you do a `PUT` with the following, `content` will **NOT** be updated

  "content": "Just like other Symfony and API Platform components, the Serializer component can be configured using annotations, XML or YAML.",
